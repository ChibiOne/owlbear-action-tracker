# Built with Daggerheaert in mind	

Easily track actions, fear, and countdowns for action scenes in Daggerheart or similar games.

Each player chooses a color. When that player takes an action, they click the "+" under that color. When they roll with Fear, the GM can add Fear the same way using the "+" under that field. When the GM spends Fear or takes an action, they click the "-" under either a player action color (when using an Action Token), or under the Fear field if using Fear. The Countdown works the same way. Increment it until it is at the number you need, then decrement it as called for by the dice rolls and narrative.
